Enhanced Multi-Objective, Performance-Driven De novo Design of Polyimides Leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning
This repository is for PI_RL: Enhanced Multi-Objective, Performance-Driven De novo Design of Polyimides Leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning.
Background
This code is the basis of our work submitted to Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling, aiming to integrate a-priori knowledge, i.e. group contribution theory, with graph neural networks and attention mechanism, and bring more insights in the prediction of thermodynamic properties. This is an alpha version of the models used to generate the resuls published in:
